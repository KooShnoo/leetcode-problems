// first idea: parition/ group by letter in advance. then we go around picking once from each group.
// itll be O(n) to group them. there's only twenty-six letters, so there's only twenty-six groups.

// keep track of 26 cooldowns, one for each letter. after completing a task, you decrement all other cooldowns,
// then you set its cooldown to `n`. to pick a new task, you look for one with zero cooldown,
// and pick a task out of the group for that letter.
// note that we have to worry about running out of tasks, potentially most cooldowns are ready but there aren't any
// tasks for that letter.
// we want to pick a group that has 1) zero cooldown, and 2) uncompleted tasks.

// map groups onto cooldowns and keep them in a vector
// keep vector length and gorups count in sync. when we deplete a group, kill that cooldown
// we just keep iterating over the array forerverand keep popping off the groups, in order.
// we do map over the array and decrement cooldowns by one every time. thats prolly not optimal. who cares.
// if there' sstill acooldown when we get atound to one group,
// we just add that to our result counter and then pop a task
